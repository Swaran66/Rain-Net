# Rainfall Prediction Using Meta Machine Learning Models

This repository presents research conducted on **Rainfall Prediction Using Remote Sensing Data and Meta-Machine Learning Models**, aiming to improve predictive accuracy by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and integrating multiple rainfall data sources.

## Overview

Rainfall prediction is a critical component of water resource management, agriculture, and disaster preparedness. However, challenges such as data scarcity, regional variability, and the inherent complexity of rainfall patterns necessitate advanced techniques to ensure accurate predictions.

This research integrates multiple remote sensing datasets with machine learning models, applying meta-modeling and bias-correction techniques to address challenges like peak underestimation, overestimation during transitions, and limited generalizability across geospatial and climatic conditions.

## Objective

The primary goal of this research was to develop a robust and accurate framework for rainfall prediction by:
1. Combining remote sensing datasets to capture diverse spatial and temporal rainfall patterns.
2. Leveraging meta-machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy and address biases in individual models.
3. Applying bias correction techniques to enhance the reliability of predictions.

## Methodology

The research methodology consists of several critical steps:

### 1. **Data Integration**
   - Datasets used include:
     - **CHIRPS**: Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data.
     - **ERA5**: ECMWF Reanalysis 5th Generation.
     - **PERSIANN**: Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks.
   - These datasets were combined and analyzed to identify patterns and discrepancies.

### 2. **Preprocessing**
   - Missing data were handled using advanced imputation techniques.
   - Outliers were identified and removed using Isolation Forest to improve data quality.
   - Data normalization was applied to standardize input features for machine learning.

### 3. **Model Development**
   - Individual baseline models were developed, including:
     - Random Forest
     - XGBoost
     - Ridge Regression
   - A **meta-model** was implemented using stacking, where predictions from the baseline models were used as inputs for the final layer.

### 4. **Bias Correction**
   - Post-model predictions were analyzed for biases such as over/underestimation.
   - Bias correction techniques were applied to improve accuracy during peak rainfall events and transitional periods.

### 5. **Evaluation**
   - Models were evaluated using metrics such as:
     - **R²**: Coefficient of determination
     - **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error
     - **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
   - Comparative analyses were performed to assess improvements from meta-modeling and bias correction.

## Results and Key Findings

The research demonstrates significant improvements in rainfall prediction accuracy through the use of meta-models and bias correction. Key highlights include:

- The meta-model consistently outperformed individual models across all evaluation metrics.
- Bias correction reduced errors during peak rainfall events by up to 15%.
- The framework exhibited strong generalization across diverse climatic and geospatial conditions.

### Evaluation Metrics (Example)

| Model          | R²   | RMSE   | MAE   |
|----------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Random Forest  | 0.65  | 101.00 | 54.32 |
| XGBoost        | 0.62  | 105.63 | 58.61 |
| Meta-Model     | 0.90  | 53.13  | 31.36 |
